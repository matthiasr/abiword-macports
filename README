This was an attempt to get Abiword compiling through
MacPorts. Sadly, although it did compile, it didn't work for me; the
documents just wouldn't be rendered correctly. Since I didn't really
need it I abandoned the attempt at that point.

If you still want to try it out, here's what to do:

- If you haven't already, get & install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/
- create an additional, local ports folder, e.g. ~/ports
- register it with MacPorts: add a new line "file:///Users/<your
username>/ports" to /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf right before
"rsync://rsync.macports.org/release/ports/ [default]" (adjust the path
suitingly)
- create the directory for the local portfile, clone the repository
and build the portindex:

mkdir -p ~/ports/editors
git clone git://github.com/matthiasr/abiword-macports.git
~/ports/editors/abiword
portindex ~/ports

- install cairo with the quartz variant

sudo port install cairo +quartz

- install abiword

sudo port install abiword

This should be it, AbiWord will be installed in /Applications/MacPorts.

Good Luck.
